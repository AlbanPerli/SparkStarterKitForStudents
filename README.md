# SparkStarterKitForStudents
Quick and dirty starter kit for students: Use some basic commands of the DJI's SDK

1) Download the project
2) Add your custom product key to info.plist: https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html#generate-an-app-key


3) Use the accelerometer carefully... ;-)

4) Use it as a starter then, write quality code, not like me!
